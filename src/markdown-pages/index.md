[Work on these (other) things](/work-on) (Jan 9 2020)


We lived in a state of dialogue for millennia, almost all knowledge was two-way communication.

Then between the printing press and radio we switched to one-way communication as the norm,
and now it's the opposite. The consequences of this are not fully appreciated.
