Some context: Me and my wife bought some former haying fields overrun with pines and [built a house](https://medium.com/@simon.sarris/designing-a-new-old-home-part-1-cf298b58ed41) there. We have been doing all the landscaping ourselves, which will take years, and now we are starting to build out a small farm.

Goals are numbered only in the order I thought of them. I will try to update this page as I succeed or fail. You can see the pass/fail of last year's goals here: [Goals for 2020](/goals2020).

I hope to keep the goals for 2021 more focused. These are roughly in order of ability to accomplish within the year:

1. Build a much larger bird house and acquire an army of geese.

❌ *Still very much pending! It should be built in 2022, and Geese will be here next year, ready or not.*

2. Build a second 'pond' area by damming the second stream better, make waterfall and stream more beautiful.

✔️ This area is dammed well, and mostly cleaned up, but there's lots more beautification to do.

3. Build beautiful field of flowers out front (already [started](https://twitter.com/simonsarris/status/1330632603989389319) this).

❌/✔️ This "worked" but scarcely. I had tilled the front to break up competing plants, but the spring drought (most likely) killed off most flowers except the bachelor's buttons, and I failed to water enough to make up for the drought. You can see some photos of what it looked like [here](https://twitter.com/simonsarris/status/1464402137333575684)

4. Build a shrine to Saint Marinus.

❌ The site is now prepared, but I have not even finalized plans, never mind built it. Having trouble going from mind to paper. I may have to make some experimental builds before I am able to decide on its proper design.

5. Continue to clear the fields and acquire sheep, if possible! Build sheep shelter.

❌/✔️ Lots of clearing has been done, but sheep are probably a few(?) years away still.

6. Finish [simeville](https://simonsarris.github.io/simeville/) and make it the website background for simonsarris.com.

❌ Barely any progress! Although I hope to do some work in december. Most of my free time has been work-work or else outside.

7. Finish book of fables and tales (started in 2020 via newsletter).

❌ While I have more tales written, I think I need many more before this can be published.

8. Build dry stone arch bridge.

❌ Alas, nothing. Much stonework was completed near the house, though. (But, somehow, "finish the stone wall, terrace, and ornamental garden beds" didn't make it into my goals list.)
