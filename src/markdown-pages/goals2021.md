Some context: Me and my wife bought some former haying fields overrun with pines and [built a house](https://medium.com/@simon.sarris/designing-a-new-old-home-part-1-cf298b58ed41) there. We have been doing all the landscaping ourselves, which will take years, and now we are starting to build out a small farm.

Goals are numbered only in the order I thought of them. I will try to update this page as I succeed or fail. You can see the pass/fail of last year's goals here: [Goals for 2020](/goals2020).

I hope to keep the goals for 2021 more focused. These are roughly in order of ability to accomplish within the year:

1. Build a much larger bird house and acquire an army of geese.

1. Build a second 'pond' area by damming the second stream better, make waterfall and stream more beautiful.

1. Build beautiful field of flowers out front (already [started](https://twitter.com/simonsarris/status/1330632603989389319) this).

1. Build a shrine to Saint Marinus.

1. Continue to clear the fields and acquire sheep, if possible! Build sheep shelter.

1. Finish [simeville](https://simonsarris.github.io/simeville/) and make it the website background for simonsarris.com.

1. Finish book of fables and tales (started in 2020 via newsletter).

1. Build dry stone arch bridge.
