# Bookshelf

This page is meant only as a starting point for recommendations that probably have the broadest appeal.

As always, the most valuable book is the one you read twice.

## History

The first three books taken together clear up considerable blind spots in the average person's view of history. For re-reading, the audiobook versions of all three are quite good.

[Against the Grain: A Deep History of the Earliest States](https://amzn.to/3mgesmA) by James Scott

[The Origins of Political Order: From Prehuman Times to the French Revolution](https://amzn.to/3mi4QaV) by Francis Fukuyama - Maybe the most underrated book of the last ten years.

[An American Childhood](https://amzn.to/3q8uMIj) by Annie Dillard

[Sexual Personae](https://amzn.to/3lcv1yd) - Despite the title it might be better thought of as an opinionated overview of the history of Western art.
