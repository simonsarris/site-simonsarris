This is a list of brands and sites I have found useful for babies.

## Clothes

If you live in a cold climate and want to get your baby outside at night, or don't keep bedrooms warm, it is worth considering wool clothing. The shop [mama owl](https://mamaowl.net/) and their house brand (siskin) have been good for this. They have many other great products.



## Baby bottles and pacifiers

Glass baby bottles and rubber nipples by the brand Natursutten have worked well.
