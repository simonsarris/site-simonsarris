    let me just say that CSS3 is rad as hell but
    it's not any easier to program for the web in 2020 than
    it was in 2010 or 2000. In a way we have failed everyone.

              <p>Gallery coming soon. For now, there's <a href="https://www.instagram.com/simonsarris" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.
              <p>I post lots of documentary-style photos to twitter, such as
                <a href="https://twitter.com/simonsarris/status/1164147316745523200" target="_blank">Pictures of Home</a> and photo-blogging
                <a href="https://twitter.com/simonsarris/status/1183143604925190144" target="_blank">my Home, the first year</a>.
              <p>I advocate at-least-one-photo-a-day, partly because it teaches us to notice our surroundings more, partly for the huge
              boost to memory, partly because looking back on the record of normal day to day
              life is its own kind of beautiful. Your own aesthetic tastes are a kind of self discovery,
              and one of the best ways to exercise this self discovery is through photography.
              It compels you to ponder what is meaningful and beautiful in your surroundings.
              Once you know this, you can make them more beautiful.
              I share photos because I want to make people feel wonder and emotions that are difficult
              to put into words but feel very right to "show." If you see and capture them you can
              show that they exist as part of the landscape, that emotions surround us, they are not just internal.
              <p>Photos, like paintings, help you see the moods that inhabit the world.

              <p>For micro-blogging I use <a href="https://twitter.com/simonsarris" target="_blank">my Twitter</a> a lot lately.

                <a href="https://simonsarris.substack.com/" target="_blank">Substack</a>.

              <p><strong>This is the old version of <a href="https://simonsarris.com">simonsarris.com</a></strong>, which was just HTML and CSS and some images.
                The town and flying birds are done with CSS animation, there is some explanation in the code comments.</p>

              <p>At work I make: <a href="http://gojs.net" target="_blank">GoJS</a>, a diagramming library for the web. My resume is <a href="/SimonSarrisResume.pdf">here</a>.
              <p>I can be found on <a href="https://twitter.com/simonsarris" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.
                I can be contacted by driving around new hampshire and shouting my name or else simonsarris at gmail works too.
              <p>Simeville, which you behold, is based on a 1550's painting by Sebastian Münster of Speyer, Germany.
                We find great consolation in landscape, don't we? And architecture, good or bad, twists and turns our moods.
              <p>This site uses no JavaScript in its interactivity, only CSS transitions and animation.
              <p>In labouring to be concise, I become obscure.
